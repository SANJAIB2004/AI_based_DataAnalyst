## üöÄ Demo

### Natural Language Query Example
Ask: "Show me the top 5 employees by salary"

The AI automatically generates:
```sql
SELECT name, salary, department 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 5
```

### Supported Query Types
- Data retrieval: "What are the total sales by region?"
- Aggregations: "Show me average salary by department"
- Joins: "List all employees with their sales totals"
- Data modifications: "Update John's salary to 80000"
- Schema operations: "Create a new table for products"

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Groq API key (get one from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com))
- Database server (for MySQL/PostgreSQL)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

1. **Run the application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. **Open your browser**
Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

3. **Configure your setup**
   - Enter your Groq API key in the sidebar
   - Choose your database type
   - Connect to your database or create a sample one

4. **Start querying!**
   - Use natural language to ask questions about your data
   - Execute SQL queries directly
   - Visualize results instantly

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Configuration

### SQLite
- Create a new sample database with demo data
- Upload an existing `.db`, `.sqlite`, or `.sqlite3` file

### MySQL
```python
Host: localhost
Port: 3306
Username: your_username
Password: your_password
Database: your_database_name
```

### PostgreSQL
```python
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Username: your_username
Password: your_password
Database: your_database_name
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### 1. Natural Language Queries
- "Show me all employees earning more than $70,000"
- "What's the average sale amount by region?"
- "List the top 10 products by revenue"
- "How many employees work in each department?"

### 2. Direct SQL Queries
```sql
SELECT e.name, e.department, SUM(s.amount) as total_sales
FROM employees e
JOIN sales s ON e.id = s.employee_id
GROUP BY e.id, e.name, e.department
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

### 3. CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Design and create new tables with custom schemas
- **Insert**: Add new records with form-based input
- **Update**: Modify existing data with safety checks
- **Delete**: Remove records with confirmation

## üé® Features in Detail

### AI-Powered SQL Generation
- Uses Groq's LLaMA 3 70B model for accurate SQL generation
- Context-aware query generation based on your database schema
- Handles complex queries including JOINs, aggregations, and subqueries

### Visual Database Explorer
- Browse all tables and their structures
- View column names and data types
- Preview sample data from each table

### Automatic Visualizations

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables (Optional)
Create a `.env` file:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
DEFAULT_DB_TYPE=sqlite
```
